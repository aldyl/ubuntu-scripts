Ubuntu Xenial post-installation scripts
=======================================

Here are the scripts I use to automatise installation of an Ubuntu or Ubuntu Gnome workstation.

Main script to be called is **post-install**. As it needs to run some **sudo** commands to install packages, you'll be prompted for your session password.

It takes few parameters according to the distribution type you are installing and the options you want.

| **--ubuntu**       | Run post-installation for a Ubuntu distribution (unity)  |
| **--ubuntugnome**  | Run post-installation for a Ubuntu Gnome distribution |
| **--assistance**   | Add remote assistance tools |
